**Breakthrough Method of Agile AI Driven Development** — An AI-driven agile development module for the BMad Method Module Ecosystem, the best and most comprehensive Agile AI Driven Development framework that has true scale-adaptive intelligence that adjusts from bug fixes to enterprise systems.

**100% free and open source.** No paywalls. No gated content. No gated Discord. We believe in empowering everyone, not just those who can pay for a gated community or courses.

## Why the BMad Method?

Traditional AI tools do the thinking for you, producing average results. BMad agents and facilitated workflows act as expert collaborators who guide you through a structured process to bring out your best thinking in partnership with the AI.

- **AI Intelligent Help** — Ask `/bmad-help` anytime for guidance on what's next
- **Scale-Domain-Adaptive** — Automatically adjusts planning depth based on project complexity
- **Structured Workflows** — Grounded in agile best practices across analysis, planning, architecture, and implementation
- **Specialized Agents** — 12+ domain experts (PM, Architect, Developer, UX, Scrum Master, and more)
- **Party Mode** — Bring multiple agent personas into one session to collaborate and discuss
- **Complete Lifecycle** — From brainstorming to deployment

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20+

```bash
npx bmad-method install
```

Follow the installer prompts, then open your AI IDE (Claude Code, Codex, Windsurf, etc.) in your project folder.

**Non-Interactive Installation** (for CI/CD):

```bash
npx bmad-method install --directory /path/to/project --modules bmm --tools claude-code --yes
```

[See all installation options](http://docs.bmad-method.org/how-to/non-interactive-installation/)

> **Not sure what to do?** Run `/bmad-help` — it tells you exactly what's next and what's optional. You can also ask questions like `/bmad-help I just finished the architecture, what do I do next?`

## Modules

BMad Method extends with official modules for specialized domains. Available during installation or anytime after.
