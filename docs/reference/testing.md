# Testing Options

BMad provides a built-in QA agent for quick test automation and a separate Test Architect (TEA) module for advanced testing.

## Built-in QA (Quinn)

Use the built-in QA agent for fast, straightforward test coverage:

- Trigger: `QA` or `bmad-bmm-qa-automate`
- Best for: small projects, quick coverage, standard patterns

## Test Architect (TEA) Module

TEA is a standalone module with advanced testing workflows (test design, ATDD, automate, review, trace, NFR assessment).

- Documentation: <https://bmad-code-org.github.io/bmad-method-test-architecture-enterprise/>
- Install: `npx bmad-method@alpha install` and select the TEA module
