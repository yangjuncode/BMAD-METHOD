# Commands

BMAD slash commands are generated by the installer for your IDE and **reflect the modules you have installed**.  
That means the authoritative list lives **in your project**, not in a static docs page.

## How to Discover Commands (Recommended)

- Type `/bmad` in your IDE and use autocomplete to browse agents/workflows.
- Run `/bmad-help` to get guided next steps and context-aware recommendations.

## Where Commands Are Generated

The installer writes command files into your project (example paths for Claude Code):

- `.claude/commands/bmad/<module>/agents/`
- `.claude/commands/bmad/<module>/workflows/`

These folders are the **canonical, project-specific command list**.

## Common Commands

- `/bmad-help` - Interactive help and next-step guidance
- `/bmad:<module>:agents:<agent>` - Load an agent (e.g. `/bmad:bmm:agents:dev`)
- `/bmad:<module>:workflows:<workflow>` - Run a workflow (e.g. `/bmad:bmm:workflows:create-prd`)

## Why This Page Is Short

BMAD is modular, so the exact commands vary by install.  
Use your IDE's autocomplete or the generated command folders above to see *everything* available.
