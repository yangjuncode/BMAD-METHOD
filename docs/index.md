description: AI-driven development framework with specialized agents, guided workflows, and intelligent planning
---

The BMad Method (**B**uild **M**ore **A**rchitect **D**reams) is an AI-driven development framework module within the BMad Method Ecosystem that helps you build software through the whole process from ideation and planning all the way through agentic implementation. It provides specialized AI agents, guided workflows, and intelligent planning that adapts to your project's complexity, whether you're fixing a bug or building an enterprise platform.

If you're comfortable working with AI coding assistants like Claude, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot, you're ready to get started.

## How to Use These Docs

These docs are organized into four sections based on what you're trying to do:

| Section           | Purpose                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tutorials**     | Learning-oriented. Step-by-step guides that walk you through building something. Start here if you're new. |
| **How-To Guides** | Task-oriented. Practical guides for solving specific problems. "How do I customize an agent?" lives here.  |
| **Explanation**   | Understanding-oriented. Deep dives into concepts and architecture. Read when you want to know *why*.       |
| **Reference**     | Information-oriented. Technical specifications for agents, workflows, and configuration.                   |

## Extend and Customize

Want to expand BMad with your own agents, workflows, or modules? The **[BMad Builder](https://bmad-builder-docs.bmad-method.org/)** provides the framework and tools for creating custom extensions, whether you're adding new capabilities to BMad or building entirely new modules from scratch.

## What You'll Need

BMad works with any AI coding assistant that supports custom system prompts or project context. Popular options include:

- **[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com)** — Anthropic's CLI tool (recommended)
- **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh)** — AI-first code editor
- **[Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)** — OpenAI's terminal coding agent

You should be comfortable with basic software development concepts like version control, project structure, and agile workflows. No prior experience with BMad-style agent systems is required—that's what these docs are for.
