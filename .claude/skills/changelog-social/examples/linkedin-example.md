🚀 **Announcing BMad Method v6.0.0 Beta - AI-Native Agile Development Framework**

I'm excited to share that BMad Method, the open-source AI-driven agile development framework, is entering Beta! After 27 alpha releases and countless community contributions, we're approaching a major milestone.

**What's New in v6.0.0-alpha.23**

🪟 **Windows Compatibility Fixed**
We've resolved the installer issues that affected Windows users. The menu arrows problem, CRLF handling, and ESM compatibility are all resolved.

🎯 **Enhanced PRD Workflows**
Our Product Requirements Document workflows now include validation and editing capabilities, with a new cohesion check that ensures your documents flow beautifully. Subprocess optimization is coming soon to save even more context.

🔧 **Workflow Creator & Validator**
New tools for creating and validating workflows with subprocess support, path violation checks, and optimization suggestions that go beyond simple error checking.

📚 **New Documentation Platform**
We've launched docs.bmad-method.org using the Diataxis framework - providing clear separation between tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and references. Our documentation is being continuously revised and expanded.

💡 **Brainstorming Revolution**
Our brainstorming workflows now use research-backed techniques: 100+ idea goals, anti-bias protocols, chain-of-thought reasoning, and simulated temperature prompts for higher divergence.

**Our Philosophy**

Everything in BMad Method is FREE. No paywalls, no gated content, no premium tiers. We believe knowledge should be shared, not sold. This is community-driven development at its finest.

- 27 commits in this release
- 217 documentation links converted
